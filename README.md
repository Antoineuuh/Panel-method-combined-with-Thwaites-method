# Introduction

Aerodynamic analysis of a NACA0012 airfoil using a combined approach of the vortex panel method and Thwaites’ method for various angles of attack.

# Potential flow past the airfoil

By satisfying no penetration condition and Kutta-Joukowski condition, a system of linear algebraic equations
has to be solved for the unknown strengths over the panel is created, with which, the lift
coefficients and pressure distribution can be predicted.
